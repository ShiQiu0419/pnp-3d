# PnP-3D 
This is a pytorch implementation of PnP-3D module.

## Usage
* Although in our sample codes the neighbor searching algorithm is knn, you may simply replace [it](https://github.com/ShiQiu0419/pnp-3d/blob/4e516ed750d0764176cd6f50dff4194f0905607f/pytorch/pnp3d.py#L37) with other algorithm/neighbor indices.

## Abstract
With the help of the deep learning paradigm, many point cloud networks have been invented for visual analysis. However, there is great potential for development of these networks since the given information of point cloud data has not been fully exploited. To improve the effectiveness of existing networks in analyzing point cloud data, we propose a plug-and-play module, PnP-3D,
